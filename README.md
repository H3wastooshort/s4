# s4
 some pretty dead project of mine that was supposed to provide very fast and basic HTML restaurant menus

everything is probably broken

i came up with it during the september holidays of 2021 and worked on it a while after. then it just slowly went cold

# what it was supposed to be
S4 is an unfinished web project by me.

S4 was supposed to be a light weight digital food menu meant to work on most web browsers (even IE sort of) and be as small as possible (for the user loading a page) while still offering good looks by css styling. 

I came up with the idea after remembering a particularly bad digital food menu that loaded everything in with javascript and took ages to load on my throttled (data cap used up) mobile data connection.
